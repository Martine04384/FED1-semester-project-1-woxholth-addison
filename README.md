A responsive website promoting the interactive Community Science Museum, designed for children and families.

## Description

Semester Project 1 is a website for the Community Science Museum, a fictional interactive museum aimed at children aged 7–15 and their families. The site is designed to spark curiosity, encourage learning, and inspire families to plan a visit.

The website was developed as the final assignment for the first semester of Noroff’s Frontend Development course. The main goal was to design and build an accessible, engaging, and responsive website using the skills learned in Design, HTML, and CSS.

The project was planned and tracked using a GitHub Project Board to stay organized and ensure a structured development process.
